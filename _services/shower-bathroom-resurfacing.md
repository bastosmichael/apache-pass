1. **Update Look**: Refresh the appearance of your shower and bathroom surfaces.
2. **Repair Damage**: Address chips, cracks, and worn surfaces.
3. **Enhance Durability**: Apply a durable coating to extend the life of your bathroom fixtures.

## Process

Our detailed process ensures a high-quality, long-lasting finish.

### Cleaning and Preparation

We start by thoroughly cleaning the surfaces to remove soap scum, grime, and mineral deposits.

### Repairs

Any damage, such as chips or cracks, is repaired to create a smooth surface for the new coating.

### Application

We apply a bonding agent followed by multiple layers of a durable, high-gloss coating to renew the surfaces.

### Curing

The coating is allowed to cure, resulting in a hard, glossy finish that revitalizes your bathroom.
