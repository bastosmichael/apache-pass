1. **Restore Shine**: Renew the glossy finish of your toilet.
2. **Repair Damage**: Fix chips and cracks for a smooth surface.
3. **Prolong Lifespan**: Extend the life of your toilet with a durable new coating.

Our process ensures a thorough and long-lasting finish.

### Cleaning and Preparation

We start by cleaning the toilet thoroughly to remove all dirt and grime, ensuring the surface is ready for treatment.

### Repairs

We repair any visible damage to ensure a smooth and even surface for the new coating.

### Application

A bonding agent is applied, followed by multiple layers of a durable, high-gloss coating that provides a fresh look.

### Curing

The coating is allowed to cure, resulting in a hard, durable finish that looks new.
