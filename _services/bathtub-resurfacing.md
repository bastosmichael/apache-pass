# Objectives

Bathtub resurfacing is a cost-effective way to renew your tub's appearance without the hassle and expense of a full replacement.

1. **Enhance Aesthetics**: Restore the original shine and finish of your bathtub.
2. **Improve Durability**: Apply a durable coating that extends the life of your tub.
3. **Increase Home Value**: Updated fixtures can add value to your home.

## Process

Our resurfacing process involves several steps to ensure a high-quality finish.

### Cleaning and Preparation

We thoroughly clean the bathtub to remove any soap scum, mineral deposits, and grime. This step is crucial for ensuring that the resurfacing materials adhere properly.

### Repairs

Any chips, cracks, or other damages are repaired using specialized materials. This ensures a smooth and even surface for the final coating.

### Application

A bonding agent is applied to create a strong adhesion between the old surface and the new finish. Multiple layers of a durable coating are then sprayed on, providing a fresh and resilient surface.

### Curing

The newly applied coating is allowed to cure, creating a hard, glossy finish that looks like new.

## Benefits

- **Cost-Effective**: Resurfacing is significantly less expensive than replacing the entire bathtub.
- **Quick Turnaround**: Most jobs can be completed in a day, minimizing disruption to your home.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Reduces waste by restoring your existing bathtub instead of discarding it.
